## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  The stadium has a roof that can open or close. During this game, the
  roof is open.
- Assets:
  I think the most important assets to protect are the people that are
  in the stadium. This includes the teams that are playing along with any
  coaches, trainers, cheerleaders or other people in the stadium, the fans
  in the regular seats and the boxes, and people working in the stadium.
  In addition, there will probably be people who live or work around the
  stadium, so any attack that occurs inside the stadium will affect the
  surrounding community as well. In addition, the networks that the
  stadium uses for its scoreboard needs to be protected. Fans will purchase
  food using credit and debit cards, so all of those networks are assets
  as well.
- Threats:
  The largest thread would be a threat to physically harm the people in the
  stadium. I will focus on protecting this threat, because it has the greatest
  potential for loss of life.
