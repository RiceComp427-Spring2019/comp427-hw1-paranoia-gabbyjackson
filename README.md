The homework specifications, as well as the corresponding course slide decks,
can be found on the [Comp427 Piazza](https://piazza.com/class/jqifhp864b37ju).
This assignment is due **Thursday, January 17 at 6 p.m.**

You will do this homework by editing the _README.md_ file. It's in

## Problem 1
- Scenario: {Stadium}
- Assumptions:
  The stadium has a roof that can open or close. During this game, the
  roof is open.
- Assets:
  I think the most important assets to protect are the people that are
  in the stadium. This includes the teams that are playing along with any
  coaches, trainers, cheerleaders or other people in the stadium, the fans
  in the regular seats and the boxes, and people working in the stadium.
  In addition, there will probably be people who live or work around the
  stadium, so any attack that occurs inside the stadium will affect the
  surrounding community as well. In addition, the networks that the
  stadium uses for its scoreboard needs to be protected. Fans will purchase
  food and items using credit and debit cards, so all of those networks
  are assets as well.
- Threats:
  The largest thread would be a threat to physically harm the people in the
  stadium. I will focus on protecting this threat, because it has the greatest
  potential for loss of life. An enemy could attempt to bomb the stadium from
  the air, killing a good portion of fans, players and workers. Alternatively,
  they could attempt to enter the stadium through the ground with weapons and
  attack people from the inside, either on the field or in the stands. There
  could also be an intentional poisoning, if someone tampered with the food
  supply at some point before or during the game. In addition to these
  physical threats, an enemy could attempt to hack into any amount of
  networks that are running through the stadium, whether they relate to
  payments, the scoreboard, or communications.
- Countermeasures:
  To prevent the physical attacks, I would take a twofold approach. I would
  first protect the air, by working with local law enforcement, military bases
  and airports nearby to ensure that airspace within a 1 mile radius was safe.
  If there was a blimp, like the Goodyear blimp, that was scheduled to fly over
  the stadium, I would have the blimp and its drivers searched before the flight.
  I considered stationing guards on the blimps, but this seems like an expensive
  countermeasure. Security guards that were already hired could search the blimp
  before it takes off, and I think this type of attack is not very likely.
  The second part of the approach would concern ground defenses. I would
  station security around all of the team locker rooms and areas, as well as
  any tunnels going in or out of the stadium. In addition, I would have every
  single person entering the stadium searched thoroughly, so there is no
  weaponry brought in. This is an expensive measure, but I think that the costs
  are worth it. The benefit of having these searches is that we know that no
  person is entering the premises with a weapon.
